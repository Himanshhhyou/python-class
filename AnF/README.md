# Algorithm & Flowchart
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It serves as a blueprint for solving problems and is often expressed in pseudocode or a programming language. Algorithms are essential in computer science, guiding the execution of tasks efficiently.

A flowchart is a visual representation of an algorithm, using different shapes to denote various actions, decisions, or inputs. It provides a graphical overview of the algorithm's logic and helps in understanding the flow of control.

###  Sum of two numbers
```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Read num1 and num2
Step 3 : Add num1 and num2 and assign in result
            result = num1 + num2
Step 4 : print result
Step 5 : Stop
```

### Factorial
The factorial of a non-negative integer, often denoted by the symbol "!", is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that integer. For example, the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is calculated as:
5!=5×4×3×2×1=120

```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Read num and declare fact = 1
Step 3 : is num > 0, if yes then go to next step otherwise go to step 6
Step 4 : fact = fact * num
Step 5 : num = num -1 and go to step 3
Step 6 : print fact
Step 7 : Stop
```
